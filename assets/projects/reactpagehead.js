#Project: React-PageHead
##[React-PageHead](http://www.dkrichards.com "React-PageHead")

React-PageHead is my first published project. I published it to NPM under ISC license.
                   
In 2014, when Google announced their ability to crawl JavaScript content, a whole
new world of SEO capabilities were revealed. React-PageHead exists to tap into 
this new world.

React-PageHead renders dynamic page head content - meta tags, titles, scripts, 
etc. - on a per-component basis. Feed it an object of tags and it will parse them
and write them to the DOM.

I spent a few weeks watching my changes appear on Google results. In time, I 
finally felt confident enough in my project to publish it.

The project is available on [NPM](<https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pagehead "React-PageHead on NPM")
and [GitHub])(https://github.com/dkrichards86/react-pagehead "React-PageHead on GitHub").
`
};
